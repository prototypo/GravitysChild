# TODO

## Include a [MacGuffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin)?

Possibly include a MacGuffin, possibly a genetically engineered monkey-like pet with vocal skills and cognition similar to a 10-year-old human. Assign the protagonist the MacGuffin, or have him find it, then have it turn out later that the completely honest MacGuffin is acting as an unwitting spy for an antagonist.

The much-loved pet should be simultaneously guilty of spying, and causing the protagonist harm, but completely blameless. It should be an unwitting pawn in a game it cannot understand.

## Things to Maybe Include

The average age of a spacecraft in low Earth orbit may be measured in weeks, months or at best a few years. The tenuous Thermosphere is nearly half oxygen and half helium at those altitudes with sensible amounts of hydrogen thrown in for good measure. Oxygen and helium atoms slam into spacecraft at speeds of kilometers per second, imparting momentum even with their tiny masses. It is the oxygen, four times heavier than helium, that is responsible for most of the impact. Their drag slowly pulls LEO spacecraft to a fiery end.

\begin{itemize}
\item{The tiny NEO is diverted into a horseshoe orbit around Earth by the three satellites helping Albatenius.}
\item{The asteroid throws Albatenius and two others out of Earth orbit toward the asteroid belt.}
\end{itemize}

Yaogan 72-01F and Hotbird 16B merge to create a weapon with power, computation, steering, and plastic explosive. It will be used to divert a larger asteroid.

For the explosive, use properties similar to C4 (from Wikipedia):

When detonated, C-4 rapidly decomposes to release nitrogen, water and carbon oxides as well as other gases.[8] The detonation proceeds at an explosive velocity of 8,092 m/s (26,550 ft/s).

### Later Chapters

- Find a way to explore ares of the population outside of the dunbars. This might include other countries, islands, or areas within the mainstream where the dunbar system hasn't completed its takeover. Aapo needs to temporarily physically escape the authorities at some point.

- Does the conventicle that moves Mars exist within or outside of the dunbar/temple/sanctuary system? Probably inside a sanctuary, where politics is more dynamic than it can be in the dunbars. Some conventicles may be allowed, or tolerated, and others exist beyond the approved limits.

- Complete the Note to the Reader (front-back-matter/note-to-the-reader.tex) once the terminology (terminology.md) is complete.

- Later chapter: There is crisis on Earth as it disturbs Earth's orbit. The result is to move Earth slightly outward, back toward the middle of the Goldilocks Zone, and assisting with global warming.
