# Dramatis Personae

## Principals

Aapo Filandros, protagonist. Male math prodigy. Learned the infinitesimal calculus, differential equations, group theory, via a computer game. His given name is Hebrew for "father of many countries", and his surname is Greek for "friend to all".

Garbi Elizondo, founder of Eliza. Originally a capitalist /trillionaire/ who used his patronage to break down patronage. His original killer app that made his fortune was socially subversive, allowing the rise of Eliza to fill a gap from within the system. Originally a Basque separatist. His given name means "pure" and his surname is a non-patronymic name meaning "by the church").

Guang ("Glorious"), the female priest who confronts Aapo and offers his mother a choice. Her androgynous name should not be confused with Gang ("powerful"), a male name.
