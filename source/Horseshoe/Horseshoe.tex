\chapter{Horseshoe}

The average age of a spacecraft in low Earth orbit may be measured in weeks, months or at best a few years. The tenuous Thermosphere is nearly half oxygen and half helium at those altitudes with sensible amounts of hydrogen thrown in for good measure. Oxygen and helium atoms slam into spacecraft at speeds of kilometers per second, imparting momentum even with their tiny masses. It is the oxygen, four times heavier than helium, that is responsible for most of the impact. Their drag slowly pulls LEO spacecraft to a fiery end.

\begin{itemize}
\item{The tiny NEO is diverted into a horseshoe orbit around Earth by the three satellites helping Albatenius.}
\item{The asteroid throws Albatenius and the Yaogan 72-01F/Hotbird 16B pair out of Earth orbit toward the asteroid belt.}
\end{itemize}

Yaogan 72-01F and Hotbird 16B merge to create a weapon with power, computation, steering, and plastic explosive. It will be used to divert a larger asteroid.
