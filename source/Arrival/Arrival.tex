\chapter{Arrival}

TODO: Aapo arrives at a Sanctuary for further education. He sees but does not meet the Ecclesical at the greeting ceremony. He learns to think without his slate, but is scheduled to receive his first embed. He is warned that many robotic surgeries will be required to keep up his embed as he grows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Note similarity of Elisa's name with Eliza and resolve.
\item Aapo's first tute: See \url{https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/intro-astronomy/libration} re libration of the Earth's Moon.
\item Discussion between senior members regarding the new cohort? (Show, don't tell)
\item Model the senior leadership of Eliza like in Plato's Republic. This includes relationships to children, foreign policy.
\end{itemize}
