TODO: Yaogan 72-01F/Hotbird 16B find a target in the asteroid belt and divert its orbit.

For the explosive, use properties similar to C4 (from Wikipedia):

When detonated, C-4 rapidly decomposes to release nitrogen, water and carbon oxides as well as other gases.[8] The detonation proceeds at an explosive velocity of 8,092 m/s (26,550 ft/s).
